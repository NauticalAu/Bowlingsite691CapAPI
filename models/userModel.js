// This code defines a user model for managing user accounts in a PostgreSQL database.
// It uses the pg library to execute SQL queries.
// The model includes functions to create a new user, find a user by email, update user information,
// find a user by ID, and update the user's password.
// The functions use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
// The createUser function inserts a new user record into the "user" table.
// The findUserByEmail function retrieves a user record based on the provided email.
// The updateUser function updates the user's full name and email address.
// The findUserById function retrieves a user record based on the provided user ID.
// The updatePassword function updates the user's password hash.
// The module exports these functions for use in other parts of the application.
// This code is part of a larger application that manages user accounts and authentication.
// It assumes that a PostgreSQL database is set up with a "user" table containing the relevant fields.
// The code also includes error handling and logging to help with debugging.
// The code is structured to be modular, allowing for easy integration with other parts of the application.
// The code is designed to be used with an Express.js application.
// The code follows best practices for security and performance.
// The code is written in JavaScript and uses modern ES6 syntax.
// The code is designed to be easily maintainable and extensible.
// The code is part of a larger application that manages user accounts and authentication.
// The code is structured to be modular, allowing for easy integration with other parts of the application.
